Chapter 2
In the beginning, the table was not flat. Happiness, George decided, was really a rare thing.
After George took to scratching the table with an iron hook, the table started to regain shape.
He recalled his previous dream about a hook. The journey to the kitchen had been planned months in advance by a team of expert chefs. Their opinions on the meals that would be cooked there would be decisive in the coming conflict.
Copper and brass were precious elements in the fight against bad cooking and endives. The massive attack by a group of endive-loving liberal red-necks had left the previous kitchen in a mess. Thankfully, gnome one was hurt and everything wound up smelling of pickles.
It turns out that gnome one (or 'onesy') as they liked to call him sued the pants off the Elven council because of the abuse he received (remember ; 'gnome one was hurt') and got to take home a hefty bag of gold coins.
